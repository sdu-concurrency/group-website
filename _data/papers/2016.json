    "abstract": "Microservices is an architectural style inspired by service-oriented computing that has recently started gaining popularity. Jolie is a programming language based on the microservices paradigm: the main building block of Jolie systems are services, in contrast to, e.g., functions or objects. The primitives offered by the Jolie language elicit many of the recurring patterns found in microservices, like load balancers and structured processes. However, Jolie still lacks some useful constructs for dealing with message types and data manipulation that are present in service-oriented computing. In this paper, we focus on the possibility of expressing choices at the level of data types, a feature well represented in standards for Web Services, e.g., WSDL. We extend Jolie to support such type choices and show the impact of our implementation on some of the typical scenarios found in microservice systems. This shows how computation can move from a process-driven to a data-driven approach, and leads to the preliminary identification of recurring communication patterns that can be shaped as design patterns.",

Carbone et al. introduced Multiparty Classical Processes, a calculus that generalises CP to multiparty session types, by replacing the duality of classical linear logic (relating two types) with a more general notion of coherence (relating an arbitrary number of types). This paper introduces variants of CP and MCP, plus a new intermediate calculus of Globally-governed Classical Processes (GCP). We show a tight relation between these three calculi, giving semantics-preserving translations from GCP to CP and from MCP to GCP. The translation from GCP to CP interprets a coherence proof as an arbiter process that mediates communications in a session, while MCP adds annotations that permit processes to communicate directly without centralised control.",

    "abstract": "A recent trend in programming language research is to use behavioral type theory to ensure various correctness properties of largescale, communication-intensive systems. Behavioral types encompass concepts such as interfaces, communication protocols, contracts, and choreography. The successful application of behavioral types requires a solid understanding of several practical aspects, from their representation in a concrete programming language, to their integration with other programming constructs such as methods and functions, to design and monitoring methodologies that take behaviors into account. This survey provides an overview of the state of the art of these aspects, which we summarize as the pragmatics of behavioral types.",

    "abstract": "Recently, unifying theories for processes combining non-determinism with quantitative aspects (such as probabilistic or stochastically timed executions) have been proposed with the aim of providing general results and tools. This paper provides two contributions in this respect. First, we present a general GSOS specification format and a corresponding notion of bisimulation for non-deterministic processes with quantitative aspects. These specifications define labelled transition systems according to the ULTraS model, an extension of the usual LTSs where the transition relation associates any source state and transition label with state reachability weight functions (like, e.g., probability distributions). This format, hence called Weight Function GSOS (WF-GSOS), covers many known systems and their bisimulations (e.g. PEPA, TIPP, PCSP) and GSOS formats (e.g. GSOS, Weighted GSOS, Segala-GSOS). <br/> The second contribution is a characterization of these systems as coalgebras of a class of functors, parametric in the weight structure. This result allows us to prove soundness and completeness of the WF-GSOS specification format, and that bisimilarities induced by these specifications are always congruences.",

    "abstract": "Timed automata, and machines alike, currently lack a general mathematical characterisation. In this paper we provide a uniform coalgebraic understanding of these devices. This framework encompasses known behavioural equivalences for timed automata and paves the way for the extension of these notions to new timed behaviours and for the instantiation of established results from the coalgebraic theory as well. Key to this work is the use of lax functors for they allow us to model time flow as a context property and hence offer a general and expressive setting where to study timed systems: the index category encodes \"how step sequences form executions\" (e.g. whether steps duration get accumulated or kept distinct) whereas the base category encodes \"step nature and composition\" (e.g. non-determinism and labels). Finally, we develop the notion of general saturation for lax functors and show how equivalences of interest for timed behaviours are instances of this notion. This characterisation allows us to reason about the expressiveness of said notions within a uniform framework and organise them in a spectrum independent from the behavioural aspects encoded in the base category.",

In recent years, with the proliferation of knowledge repositories (not only databases) in practical applications, there has also been an effort to develop implementations of consistency maintenance algorithms that have a solid theoretical basis.<br />The framework of active integrity constraints (AICs) is one example of such an effort, providing theoretical grounds for rule-based algorithms for ensuring database consistency.  An AIC consists of an integrity constraint together with a specification of actions that may be taken to repair a database that does not satisfy it.  Both denotational and operational semantics have been proposed for AICs.<br />In this paper, we describe <code>repAIrC</code>, a prototype implementation of the algorithms previously proposed targetting SQL databases, i.e., the most prolific type of databases.  Using <code>repAIrC</code>, we can both validate an SQL database with respect to a given set of AICs and compute possible repairs in case the database is inconsistent; the tool is able to work with the different kinds of repairs that have been considered, and achieves optimal asymptotic complexity in their computation.  It also implements strategies for parallelizing the search for repairs, which in many cases can make untractable problems become easily solvable.",
