## Guidelines for website content management

### Writing static pages

Static pages are in the root folder as markdown (`.md`) files.
Unless some html tags are needed, you can directly edit the content using the markdown syntax.
In case you need to add html elements and still want to write content inside of them in markdown, just remember to add the `markdown="1"` attribute to the HTML tag.

### Writing event posts

Event posts are found in `_posts` folder within the root.
There, a post is a separate `.md` file named following the convention `yyyy-mm-dd-title.md`.
The `title` is not important and the only constraint is that the first part of the name corresponds to a date formatted follow the previous rule.

The header of each file follows the convention below, which is self-explanatory.
Fields `"place"` and `"date_end"` are optional. Dates may be limited to year, month, etc.
In the main part of the post, please use the tag `<!--more-->` to set the limit of the post excerpt, used to preview the article.

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "My Fancy Title"
place: "Odense (DK)"
date: 2018-03-10 14:00:00
date_end: 2018-03-12 14:00:00
---
```

### Adding publications

Publications are added inside the `_data/papers` folder, within the root, in files named after the publication year, `preprints.json` (accepted for publication), or `draft.json` (reports etc.).
For instance, `2017.json` is a json array `[ { object_1 }, { object_2 }, ... ]` that contains papers published in 2017.
The schema for each `object` is

```json
{
    "bibitem": "BIB_CONTENT",
    "links": [
      {
        "link": "PAPERLINK",
        "name": "PAPERLINK_NAME",
        "icon": "PAPERLINK_ICON"
      },
      {
        "link": "PAPERLINK"
      }
    ],
    "type": "PAPER_TYPE",
    "tags": [ "TAG1", "TAG2", "TAG3" ],
    "authors": [ "MEMBER1" , "MEMBER2" ],
    "grants": [ "G1" , "G2" ],
    "non_group": false
}
```

Where

- `BIBLINK` is the bibitem of the paper in linearised format (no new lines);
- `"links"` contains a list of links related to the publication. For each element, if the `"name"` attribute of the element is omitted, it will be visualised using the default name `paper` and if the `"icon"` attribute of the element is omitted, it will be visualised with the [generic link icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons/link?style=solid). Valid names for icons are: `pdf`, `paper` (aliases `pdf`), `arxiv`, `corr` (aliases `arxiv`) , `site`, `website` (aliases `site`), `video`, `slides`, `generic` (the default one);
- `"type"` contains the publication type (`"book"`,`"book chapter"`,`"journal"`,`"conference"`,`"workshop"`,`"report"`, etc.) following the convention that `"report"` is for publications in `"draft.json"`;
- `"tags"` contains relevant tags/keywords for the paper, used by the by-keyword filter to select the related papers;
- `"authors"` contains relevant members in the PLS group that authored the paper. These are used by the by-author filter to select the related papers;
- `"grants"` contains possible grants that supported the publication;
- `"non_group"` is a flag (hence its related content is irrelevant) to mark the paper as not published by the group.

### Adding peoples

People entries are stored inside the `_data/people` folder, within the root, in json files.
Each person file has a name of form `"R_FULLNAME"` where `"R"` is `"A"` for members with faculy positions, `"B"` for postdocs, and `"C"` for students.
Each person follows the schema

```json
{
  "name": "NAME",
  "id": "ID",
  "role": "ROLE",
  "website": "URL",
  "email": "EMAIL ADDRESS",
  "phone": "PHONE NUMBER",
  "dblp": "ID",
  "google_scholar": "USER",
  "orcid": "ID",
  "github": "USER",
  "twitter": "USER",
  "linkedin": "USER",
  "photo": "URL",
  "research_topics": [ "TOPIC1", "TOPIC2" ]
}
```

Where

- `"id"` is used to add an id attribute in the grants page to link directly a person from other pages (e.g., `[Professor Professorson](/people#pp)` where `"pp"` is the identifier for Professor Professorson);
- `"dblp"` is optional and contains a URL to the person's entry on DBLP under "dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/" (e.g., `p/Professorson:Professor` where Professorson's dblp entry is at
`https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/p/Professorson:Professor`);
- `"google_scholar"` is optional and contains the person's profile identifier on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) (the argument `"user"` in the profile URL);
- `"orcid"` is optional and contains the person's [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) identifier;
- `"twitter"` is optional and contains the person's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) handler;
- `"linkedin"` is optional and contains the person's [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/) profile (e.g., `in/professor-professorson` where Professorson's profile is at
`https://linkedin.com/in/professor-professorson`);

Profile pictures must be 10x8 portraits and can be included in the folder `images/people` under the root.
To link the image in the json entry use the path from the root to the file, e.g., `/images/people/PHOTO.jpg`.

### Adding grants

Grant entries are stored inside the `_data` folder, within the root, in a json file named `grants.json`.
Each grant in the file follows the schema

```json
{
  "title": "NAME",
  "id": "NAME",
  "participants": [
    {
      "name": "NAME",
      "role": "ROLE",
      "affiliation": "AFF"
    }
  ],
  "website": "LINK",
  "number": "STRING",
  "period": { "start": "STRING", "end": "STRING" },
  "foundation": "STRING",
  "amount": "STRING"
}
```

The fields above should be self-explanatory.
`"id"` is used to add an `id` attribute in the grants page to link directly a specific grant from other pages.
