                        "description" : "Concurrency refers to the ability of multiple (possibly interacting) activities to overlap over time, so that one starts before the other finishes. Digital systems are a prime example of such ability for they exhibit concurrent aspects at every scale: from computing clouds to modern CPUs. Concurrency Theory is the science of concurrency. This research area started as part of Theoretical Computer Science but extends far beyond that. In fact, concurrent features appear in many different fields like Biology, Economics, Medicine, and Social Sciences. Building upon our group’s expertise in applied logic, programming languages, and software engineering, we continuously apply and advance the state-of-the-art in concurrency. Most of all, we focus on programming languages and tools to design, develop, and analyse complex concurrent systems.",

We investigate techniques for online reasoning with incomplete information that arrives over time. We apply logic and logic techniques to specify and verify properties of programming models, both by: developing logics to write and prove interesting properties; designing type systems that automatically ensure interesting properties of our systems; or studying correspondences between logic proofs and programs that allow us to view the latter in insightful new ways. Finally, we also use logic and state-of-the-art solvers to optimize real world problems such as scheduling, packing, timetabling, configuration, and logistics problems.",

Research on programming languages is not just to find solutions to important problems, but to find the best expression of those solutions, typically in the form of a language, language extension, library, program analysis, or transformation. The aim is for simple, understandable solutions that are also general since by acting at the level of a language (or its toolchain) they apply to many sorts of programs and sorts of problems. Therefore, a rigorous approach to software behaviour is critical to prove that (classes of) programs enjoy desired properties, and/or eschew undesired ones. Building upon our group’s expertise, we develop programming language solutions to the challenges issued by the growing complexity of concurrent systems, especially in the wake of the digital transformation.",

                        "description" : "Choreographic Programming is an emerging paradigm for correct-by-construction concurrent programming based on message passing. In this paradigm, communications are specified using an Alice-to-Bob notation, rather than as two separate send and receive actions. As a consequence, protocols are guaranteed not to deadlock because of communication mismatches. Models based on choreographic programming have been successfully developed for different settings where concurrent programming is challenging, including service-oriented computing and cyber-physical systems.<br />In our group, we are extending choreographic programming by developing more expressive and powerful languages that can be used in real-world applications. The main challenge is to increase expressitivy while maintaining the good theoretical properties that made choreography languages successful in the first place.",

One of the challenges involved in managing this data is ensuring its internal consistency, especially as the information being stored changes due to the evolution of the real-world data it models.<br />Modern-day database management systems address this problem by allowing the user to define integrity constraints &ndash; properties of the data that should hold at all times &ndash; and algorithms to repair the database when these properties no longer hold. Extending these techniques to more powerful reasoning tools, such as those used in the Semantic Web, is however an ongoing complex process, which we address in our research.",

A microservice is a cohesive, independent process interacting via messages. Following the microservices architectural style, a network of interacting microservices corresponds to the interconnected modules of a distributed software. Microservices are usually contrasted with traditional single executable artefacts, also called \"monoliths\". In monoliths, modules communicate via locally-available resources (memory, databases, files), making them tightly coupled together and ultimately hindering both software scalability and evolvability. The principle of microservices assists project managers and developers: it provides a guideline for the design and implementation of distributed applications. Following this principle, developers focus on the implementation and testing of a few, cohesive functionalities.  This holds also for higher-level microservices, which are concerned with coordinating the functionalities of other microservices.",

We investigate how one can compute answers to contiuous queries in an online fashion, by continuously updating the system's knowledge with incoming information, giving information about how likely it is that a particular answer will be produced.

This process has already started decades ago, but recently it has become a crucial asset for companies in highly-competing markets. At the essence of Digital Transformation there are two factors: integration and flexibility. Companies already own many digital systems, used to automate specific tasks. However, these systems are frequently silos: they are not meant to interact with other systems and the data they manage is difficult to extract and share. Integration of these legacy systems (both within the same company or belonging to different ones) as well as with recent applications, devices, and the Cloud must go hand-in-hand with a high flexibility to change how the integrated systems interact with each other. Together, these two factors lead to increased productivity, as well as better reactivity and system consistency.",
