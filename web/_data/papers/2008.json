Fault handlers, termination handlers and compensation handlers are installed at execution time instead of being statically defined. In this paper we present this programming style and our implementation of dynamic fault handling in JOLIE, providing finally a nontrivial example of its usage.",

		"abstract" : "In service oriented computing, choreography languages are used to specify multi-party service compositions. Two main approaches have been followed: the interaction-oriented approach of WS-CDL and the process-oriented approach of BPEL4Chor. We investigate the relationship between them.In particular, we consider several interpretations for interaction-oriented choreographies spanning from synchronous to asynchronous communication. Under each of these interpretations we characterize the class of interaction-oriented choreographies which have a process-oriented counterpart, and we formalize the notion of equivalence between the initial interaction-oriented choreography and the corresponding process-oriented one.",

		"abstract" : "Service Oriented Computing (SOC) allows for the composition of services which communicate using unidirectional notification or bidirectional request-response primitives. Most service orchestration languages proposed so far provide also primitives to handle faults and compensations. The interplay between fault handling and request-response invocations is nontrivial since, for instance, faults should be notified to the requestresponse communication partners in order to compensate also the remote activities. Our work is motivated by the difficulties encountered in programming, using current orchestration languages, some fault handling strategies. We propose as a solution an orchestration programming style in which fault and compensation handlers are dynamically installed. We show the adequacy of our proposal defining its semantics, and proving that it satisfies some expected high-level properties. Finally, we also show how to apply dynamic handler installation in a nontrivial automotive scenario.",

    "abstract": "Homogeneous fibring is a meta-logical constructor that produces new logics by combining logics presented in the same way (e.g. both of them endowed with an Hilbert calculus). Heterogeneous fibring (e.g. one of the logics is presented by an Hilbert calculus and the other by a sequent calculus) is an open problem that we solve now. We start by considering consequence systems as providing a solution (a good one when fibring a logic presented by semantic means and another one presented in a deductive way). However consequence systems are not good when we want to obtain as the result of fibring two deductive systems still a deductive system (where a notion of derivation appears in the fibring). The solution is to introduce the concept of (abstract) proof system. The fibring of proof systems is still a proof system and so we have that a derivation in the fibring is obtained from the derivations of the component. Some preservation results are discussed like compactness and semi-decidability.",

The completeness of the axiomatization against the measure-theoretic semantics is carried out using a variant of the Lindenbaum&ndash;Henkin technique. The independence of the axioms is analyzed, and the almost-everywhere quantifier is compared with related notions of generalized quantification.",
