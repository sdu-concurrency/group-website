		"abstract": "In the field of microservices, Model-Driven Engineering has emerged as a powerful methodology for architectural design, and new programming languages have introduced language abstractions to deal with microservice development more effectively. In this article, we present the first preliminary investigation of how the two approaches can be married, taking the LEMMA framework and the Jolie programming language as respective representatives. By developing a conceptual metamodel for Jolie, we elicit a strong link between the two approaches, which shows that there is much to gain. We discuss a few low-hanging fruits that come from our finding and present some interesting future directions that arise from our new viewpoint.",

	    "abstract": "Choreographic languages aim to express multiparty communication protocols, by providing primitives that make interaction manifest. Multitier languages enable programming computation that spans across several tiers of a distributed system, by supporting primitives that allow computation to change the location of execution. Rooted into different theoretical underpinnings—respectively process calculi and lambda calculus—the two paradigms have been investigated independently by different research communities with little or no contact. As a result, the link between the two paradigms has remained hidden for long. In this paper, we show that choreographic languages and multitier languages are surprisingly similar. We substantiate our claim by isolating the core abstractions that differentiate the two approaches and by providing algorithms that translate one into the other in a straightforward way. We believe that this work paves the way for joint research and cross-fertilisation among the two communities. ",

		"abstract": "Theory of choreographic languages typically includes a number of complex results that are proved by structural induction. The high number of cases and the subtle details in some of them lead to long reviewing processes, and occasionally to errors being found in published proofs. In this work, we take a published proof of Turing completeness of a choreographic language and formalise it in Coq. Our development includes formalising the choreographic language and its basic properties, Kleene’s theory of partial recursive functions, the encoding of these functions as choreographies, and proving this encoding correct. With this effort, we show that theorem proving can be a very useful tool in the field of choreographic languages: besides the added degree of confidence that we get from a mechanised proof, the formalisation process led us to a significant simplification of the underlying theory. Our results offer a foundation for the future formal development of choreographic languages. ",

      "abstract": "Approximation fixpoint theory (AFT) is an algebraic study of fixpoints of lattice operators that unifies various knowledge representation formalisms. In AFT, stratification of operators has been studied, essentially resulting in a theory that specifies when certain types of fixpoints can be computed stratum per stratum. Recently, novel types of fixpoints related to groundedness have been introduced in AFT. In this article, we study how those fixpoints behave under stratified operators.<br />One recent application domain of AFT is the field of active integrity constraints (AICs). We apply our extended stratification theory to AICs and find that existing notions of stratification in AICs are covered by this general algebraic definition of stratification. As a result, we obtain stratification results for a large variety of semantics for AICs.",
