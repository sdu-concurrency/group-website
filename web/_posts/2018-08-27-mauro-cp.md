[Jacopo Mauro](/people.html#jm), together with [Roberto Amadini](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/ramadini/index.html) and [Maurizio Gabbrielli](http://www.cs.unibo.it/~gabbri/), won the Silver medal at the 2018 [MiniZinc Challenge](http://www.minizinc.org/challenge.html), an international annual competition of constraint programming solvers on a variety of benchmarks.

This is the forth time Mauro stands on the MiniZinc podium thanks to the [Sunny-CP](/software.html#sunny-cp) Portfolio Solver. After winning the <em>gold medal</em> at editions 2015, 2016, and 2017 of the challenge, this year he "lost the crown" to Google's [OR-tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization/).
