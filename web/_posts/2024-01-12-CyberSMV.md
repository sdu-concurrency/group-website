The emergence of the digital economy has led to new cybersecurity challenges for Danish manufacturing companies. Small- and medium-sized manufacturers are particularly vulnerable to attacks such as ransomware, theft of intellectual property, and sabotage, and new research from SDU has shown low preparedness and lack of knowledge about cybersecurity in this sector.
Â 
To protect Danish manufacturers from these attacks, [Industriens Fond has awarded](https://industriensfond.dk/projekt/cybersikkerhed-og-forretningskontinuitet/) SDU researchers 8,5 million DKK (~1.14 million EUR) for the project [*CyberSMV: Cyber Security and Business Continuity*](https://cyber-smv.dk/). The 2.5-year project is led by [Professor Jan Stentoft](https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/da/persons/jar) and will involve ACP members [Peter Mayer, Fabrizio Montesi, and Marco Peressotti](https://acp.sdu.dk/grants.html#Cyber-SMV) as participants.
