Fabrizio Montesi and the Concurrency and Logic group will use the grant to establish a project titled "Choreographies for connected IT systems" to explore a new scientific method for ensuring that connected computer systems follow appropriate choreographies of reliable and secure data exchanges. More specifically, the project will develop a prototype of a programming language of a new kind that is rooted in existing mainstream languages like Java and provides formal logical principles to reason about changes in the locality of data and an automatic tool for integrating this new language with existing systems.

More information about the project can be found at [the project's homepage](https://www.fabriziomontesi.com/projects/choco/).
