On April 10<sup>th</sup>, [Marco Peressotti](/people.html#mp) gave a talk at the [33<sup>rd</sup> ACM/SIGAPP Symposium On Applied Computing](https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2018/) (SAC'18) about the paper "[Communications in Choreographies, Revisited](/publications.html#paper_CMP18)".
On April 11<sup>th</sup>, [Janine Weber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/j-webs) presented a poster at SAC'18 about the paper "[From the decorator pattern to circuit breakers in microservices](/publications.html#paper_paper_DBLP:conf/sac/MontesiW18)".

In "[Communications in Choreographies, Revisited](/publications.html#paper_CMP18)", [Lu√≠s Cruz-Filipe](/people.html#lcf), [Fabrizio Montesi](/people.html#fm), and [Marco Peressotti](/people.html#mp) propose a model of choreographic programming equipped with a primitive for <i>grouped interactions</i> that subsumes several communication patterns commonly used by real-world systems like multicast, scatter-gather, and atomic exchanges.
Intuitively, grouped interactions can be thought of as being carried out as one single interaction. In practice, they are implemented by processes that carry them out in a concurrent fashion. After formalising the intuitive semantics of grouped interactions, the authors prove that choreographic programs and their implementations are correct and deadlock-free by construction.

In "[From the decorator pattern to circuit breakers in microservices](/publications.html#paper_paper_DBLP:conf/sac/MontesiW18)", [Fabrizio Montesi](/people.html#fm) and [Janine Weber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/j-webs) analyse different deployment setups for circuit breaker, a design pattern for preventing cascading failures by guarding calls towards a target service. Then, they define a unifying implementation strategy in the setting of microservices, by using the Jolie programming language. Their implementation captures all setups with a single program, by interpreting a circuit breaker as a decorator that is generic on the interface of its target service.
