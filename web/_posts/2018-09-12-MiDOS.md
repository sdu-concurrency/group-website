Edition 2019 of the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (a primary gathering forum for theoretical and applied researchers in computing) will host the
first edition of MiDOS: Microservices, DevOps, and Service-Oriented Architecture (MiDOS). The track, chaired by [Lu√≠s Cruz-Filipe](/people.html#lcf), Elisabetta Di Nitto, and [Jacopo Mauro](/people.html#jm), is the natural continuation of the previous Service-Oriented Architecture and Programming (SOAP) track.

MiDOS is the first conference track focussed on Microservices and DevOps within a high-visibility academic event, such as SAC. Quoting the Call for Papers of the track:

<blockquote class="blockquote">
Our track aims to bring together researchers and practitioners having the common objective of transforming Service-Oriented, DevOps, and Microservice practices into a mature discipline with both solid scientific foundations and mature software engineering development methodologies supported by dedicated tools. In particular, we will encourage works and discussions about what (Micro)Services and DevOps still need in order to achieve their goal.
</blockquote>

MiDOS is organised in collaboration with the [Microservices Community](https://microservices.sdu.dk), of which the {{ site.group_name }} group is an active member.
