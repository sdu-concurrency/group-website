In 2017, the US-American standardization agency NIST started a standardization process for the next generation of cryptographic schemes that are designed to withstand attacks aided by quantum computers. First cryptographic schemes have been selected in 2022 for standardization - but NIST has asked for the submission of additional digital signature schemes. As part of two international research groups, [Ruben Niederhagee](/people.html#rn) contributed to the two submissions: [WAVE](https://wave-sign.org/) and [MEDS](https://www.meds-pqc.org/). They are based on different mathematical constructions, but they both have the goal to provide secure digital signatures for a future world where an attacker might be equipped with a large and powerful quantum computer.
