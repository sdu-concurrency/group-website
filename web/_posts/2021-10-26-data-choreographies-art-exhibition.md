An art exhibition called "Data Choreographies" will be opening on the
4<sup>th</sup> of November at Catch (Kulturværftet, Helsingør, Denmark), with
brilliant art inspired by our research on choreographic programming! The
exhibition will stay open for more than a month, and will then move to other
places.
