Security by Design is a software development approach that integrates security tactics and patterns from the beginning of software design to build security into the system from the ground up. In his lecture, Marco provided a high-level introduction to Formal Methods, a host of mathematically sound techniques and tools that can support the design and development of secure systems, and their adoption in industry.
