MoM2016 has been the first Italian venue dedicated to IT technologies based on microservices, ranging from practical experiences and applications, to more technical and theoretical aspects. The event has been hosted by [Monrif S.p.A.](http://www.monrifgroup.net/en/), the fifth publishing group in Italy and early adopter of microservice technologies.

At the event, small, medium, and large companies reported their experiences
with the adoption and usage of microservices in production. The event also
included discussion panels on Industry 4.0 and digitalisation as well as
academic presentations. Among these, [Saverio
Giallorenzo](/people.html#sg) gave a talk on the [interplay
between microservices and choreographies](http://www.saveriogiallorenzo.com/publications/seminars/MoM2016.pdf).
