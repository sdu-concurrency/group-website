{{ site.group_short }} organised the first [International Conference on Microservices](http://conf-micro.services/) with the aim to provide a forum for the discussion of all aspects of designing and programming microservice architectures. Both theoretical and experimental contributions are welcome, on topics ranging from formal frameworks to industrial experience reports and demonstrations.

In microservices, software components are services that can be independently deployed and scaled. This brings all the benefits, but also all the issues, of distributed computing to the internals of applications. The resulting increase in complexity calls for a proportional improvement of techniques for software construction. This requires contributions from different areas, ranging from formal methods to software engineering and the general art of programming.

The event will place particular emphasis on the identification of the challenges that the community of microservices will face in the future, promising directions, and open discussions (panels) with experts from academia and industry.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

* Design and implementation of microservice architectures.
* Empirical studies of microservices.
* Software engineering methods for microservices.
* Security in microservices.
* Formal models for microservices.
* Verification (both static and runtime) of microservice systems.
* Programming languages and techniques for microservices.
* Testing for microservices.
