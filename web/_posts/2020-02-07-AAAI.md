On February 7<sup>th</sup>, [Luís Cruz-Filipe](/people.html#lcf) presented the paper "Hypothetical Answers to Continuous Queries over Data Streams" at the [34th AAAI
 Conference on Artificial Intelligence](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-20).

In the paper, Luís Cruz-Filipe, Graça Gaspar, and Isabel Nunes present a semantics for continuous queries over data streams and corresponding hypothetical answers to questions of the kind "given the current information, is it possible that X will become true at time t?". Together with the semantics for queries and corresponding answers that covers such hypothetical answers, the authors present an online algorithm for updating the set of facts that are consistent with the currently available information.

The AAAI conference series promotes research in artificial intelligence (AI) and foster scientific exchange between researchers, practitioners, scientists, students, and engineers in AI and its affiliated disciplines. AAAI-20 is the Thirty-Fourth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence and it continues the tradition of previous AAAI conferences with technical paper presentations, invited speakers, workshops, tutorials, poster sessions, senior member presentations, competitions, and exhibit programs, all selected according to the highest standards.
