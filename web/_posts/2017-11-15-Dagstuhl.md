[Marco Peressotti](/people.html#mp) joined the Dagstuhl Seminar on [Algorithmic Cheminformatics](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=17452)
to give an invited talk on coinductive techniques for the study of concurrent complex systems.
The event kickstarted new research projects with the [Algorithms](http://algorithms.sdu.dk/) research group at IMADA thus fostering the fruitful collaboration between our groups.

Cheminformatics is the application of algorithms, combinatorial approaches, and formal methods from Computer Science to problems in Chemistry. The purpose of the Seminar was to bring together experts in different fields from Computer Science and Chemistry with the overarching goal of advancing discrete modelling approaches for chemical reaction systems, which are highly concurrent systems by nature.
[Marco Peressotti](/people.html#mp) was invited to join the Seminar as an expert in Concurrency Theory.
