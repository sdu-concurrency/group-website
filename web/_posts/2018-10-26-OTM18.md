In the paper, Giallorenzo, Lanese, and Russo proposed a system integration process advocating choreographic programs as intermediate artefacts to refine
high-level global specifications (e.g., UML Sequence Diagrams), defined
by the domain experts of each partner, into concrete, distributed implementations.

CoopIS is part of the OTM series of federated conferences along with ODBASE and C&TC. This year it was held at the Valletta Campus of the University of Malta.
