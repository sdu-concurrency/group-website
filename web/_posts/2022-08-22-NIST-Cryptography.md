NIST has recently [announced the selection of the first four algorithms](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/07/nist-announces-first-four-quantum-resistant-cryptographic-algorithms) of their [2016 Call for Proposals for Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2016/12/nist-asks-public-help-future-proof-electronic-information).

[Ruben Niederhagen](/people.html#rn) has been directly involved in the development of one of the winning digital signature algorithms, SPHINCS+, and has shared some of his thoughts [here](https://www.sdu.dk/en/om_sdu/institutter_centre/imada_matematik_og_datalogi/nyt_fra_imada/nist).
