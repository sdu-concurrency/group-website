Microservices 2019 is part of a series of conferences started with [Microservices 2017](/news/2017-10-30-Microservices_Conference.html) which successfully brought together many international practitioners and researches interested in the software paradigm of microservices.

This edition of Microservices will be co-located and intertwined with the first international edition of the [Meeting on Microservices](http://www.italianasoftware.com/mom2016_eng.html), an event specifically oriented towards companies where keynote speakers report current challenges and bleeding-edge solutions on microservices. Among the keynote speakers, [Fabrizio Montesi](/people.html#fm) will present the keynote "[Understandable Microservices](https://conf-micro.services/2019/keynotes/#understandable-microservices)".

The conference attracted many contributed talks, submitted by the community and peer-reviewed by an international committee of experts from both industry and academia.
