On March 2<sup>nd</sup>, Forskerzonen --- one of the major danish popular-science publication agencies --- [released an interview](https://videnskab.dk/teknologi-innovation/vi-laegger-vores-liv-i-haenderne-paa-computere-men-hvordan-ved-vi-vi-kan-stole) to 
[Luís Cruz-Filipe](/people.html#lcf) on how to achieve the best result in the implementation of artificial intelligence in society.

The message of Cruz-Filipe is that it is important to understand and develop various techniques for artificial intelligence, instead of focusing on a single one --- for example, pointing out how deep learning cannot make open-minded algorithms and why researchers are developing new methods for that.
